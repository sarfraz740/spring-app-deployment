*******************************************detail steps of deployment yaml file******************



spring-deployment.yml file:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-deployment
  labels:
    app: spring
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: spring-container
          image: adminmindbowser/myinterviewimage:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
            
            
In this YAML file:

metadata.name :is the name of the deployment.

spec.replicas : is the number of replicas that we want to deploy.

spec.selector.matchLabels.app is the label used to select the pods to manage.

spec.template.metadata.labels.app :is the label used to identify the pods in the deployment.

spec.template.spec.containers.name :is the name of the container.

spec.template.spec.containers.image :is the Docker image that we want to use.

spec.template.spec.containers.ports.containerPort :is the port that our application will be running on

******************************************detail steps of service yaml file*************************************
apiVersion: v1

kind: Service

metadata:
  name: my-app-service

spec:
  type: NodePort
  
  selector:
    app: spring-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30000 # you can choose any port in the range 30000-32767
   In this YAML file:
   
   The kind field indicates that this is a Service object. The metadata section contains information about the Service such as its name, which in this 
   
   case is "my-app-service".

The spec section specifies the Service's specifications, including its type which is set to NodePort. NodePort is a type of Service that exposes the 

Service on a port on each node in the cluster. This allows external traffic to reach the Service by hitting the nodes' IP addresses and the specified 

nodePort value.

The selector field is used to identify the pods that this Service will target. In this case, the Service is targeted at pods with the label app: spring-

app.

The ports section lists the ports that the Service will use. In this case, there is only one port named http with a port value of 8080, a targetPort 

value of 8080 and a nodePort value of 30000. This means that the Service will be accessible on port 30000 of the nodes in the cluster and will forward 

traffic to port 8080 on the pods targeted by the selector field.
